Chrome DevTools App.
===================

Chrome DevTools packaged as an app via [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit). 

This project is an exploration of how much work it would take to seperate Chrome DevTools from Chrome itself and to explore what a separation from the browser itself would bring to the table in terms of new functionality, etc.
